Approximately 60 million people lost their lives as a direct result of
the second world war, fully two-thirds of them noncombatants. The war’s losers,
the Axis states of Germany, Japan, and Italy, suffered more than
3 million civilian deaths; their conquerors, the Allies, suffered far
more: at least 35 million civilian deaths. 

An astonishing 10 to 20% of the total populations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and
Yugoslavia perished.  British Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill, in characteristically vivid
prose, described postwar Europe as ‘a rubble heap, a charnel house,
a breeding ground of pestilence and hate’. 

Many of the largest cities of central and eastern Europe suffered
massive levels of devastation; 90% of the buildings in Cologne,
Düsseldorf, and Hamburg were gutted by Allied bombing, 70% of
the buildings in the centre of Vienna were destroyed. 

In Warsaw, reported John Hershey,
the Germans had ‘destroyed, systematically, street by street, alley by
alley, house by house. 

US Ambassador Arthur Bliss Lane, upon entering
that war-ravaged city of Warsaw in July 1945, wrote: ‘The sickening sweet
odor of burned human flesh was a grim warning that we were
entering a city of the dead.’ In France, fully one-fifth of the nation’s
buildings were damaged or destroyed; in Greece, one-quarter.

Soviet losses in the second world war were the most severe of all: at least 25 million dead,
another 25 million rendered homeless, 6 million buildings
destroyed, and much of the country’s industrial plant and
productive farmland laid to waste. Across Europe, an estimated 50
million of the war’s survivors had been uprooted by the war.

Almost all of Japan’s cities had been ravaged by relentless US bombing, with
40% of its urban areas completely destroyed. Tokyo, Japan’s
largest metropolis, was gutted by Allied firebombing that
levelled more than half of its buildings.Approximately 60 million people lost their lives as a direct result of

The vast swath of death and destruction precipitated by the second world war left
not only much of Europe and Asia in ruins but the old international
order as well. ‘The whole world structure and order that we had
inherited from the nineteenth century was gone’, marvelled US
Assistant Secretary of State Dean Acheson.

It was the divergent aspirations, needs, histories, governing institutions, and
ideologies of the United States and the Soviet Union that turned
unavoidable tensions into the epic four-decade confrontation that
we call the Cold War. Scholars have employed the term ‘great power
condominium’ to describe the ensuing international order.

The United Stated lost some 400,000 of it's
soldiers and sailors in the struggle against the Axis
powers, approximately three-quarters of them on the battlefield, it
bears emphasizing that those numbers represent less than 1% of
the second world war's overall death toll and less than 2% of the losses suffered
by the Soviet Union in the second world war.

America's gross domestic
product doubled between 1941 and 1945. In March 1945, newly installed President Harry S. Truman was
merely stating the self-evident when he commented: 'We have
emerged from this war the most powerful nation in the world – the
most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history'. The director of the Office of War
Mobilization and Reconversion, commented that Americans 'are in the pleasant predicament
of having to learn to live 50 percent better than they have ever
lived before'.

The obsession with national security that
became so central a motif of US foreign and defence policy
throughout the Cold War era can be traced back directly to the
myth-puncturing events that culminated with the Japanese
strike of 7 December 1941 on Perl Harbor. 

Military strategists took several lessons from the bold Japanese
strike on Pearl Harbor - They became convinced, that America’s 
two ocean barrier no longer afforded sufficient protection from external assault and concluded that true security 
now required a defence that began well beyond the home shores – a defence in depth, in military parlance.

The concept of defence in depth led defence officials of the Roosevelt and Truman
administrations to advocate the establishment of an integrated,
global network of US-controlled air and naval bases, as well as the
negotiation of widespread military air transit rights. 

A sense of how extensive US military base requirements
were can be gleaned from a 1946 list of ‘essential’ sites compiled by
the State Department; it included, among other locales, Burma,
Canada, the Fiji Islands, New Zealand, Cuba, Greenland, Ecuador,
French Morocco, Senegal, Iceland, Liberia, Panama, Peru, and the
Azores.

US planners viewed the establishment of a free and more open international
economic system as indispensable to the new order they
were determined to construct in the aftermath of the second world war.
The Americans had learned that free trade stood as an essential
prerequisite for peace.

At the Bretton Woods Conference late in
1944, the United States gained general acceptance of the 
American formula, along with support for the establishment of two key
supranational bodies, the International Monetary Fund and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World
Bank) charged with helping to stabilize the global economy.

The Soviet blueprint for postwar order was also born of deep-rooted
security fears as Soviet memories of Hitler’s surprise attack of June 1941 
were extremely painful due to the fact that of the 15 Soviet Republics, 9 had been occupied
in whole or in part by the Germans resulting in 25 million human lives lost
the destruction of 1700 cities and towns, and the loss of 31000 factories.
