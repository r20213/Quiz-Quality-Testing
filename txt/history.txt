Approximately 60 million people lost their lives as a direct result of
the second world war, fully two-thirds of them noncombatants. The war’s losers,
the Axis states of Germany, Japan, and Italy, suffered more than
3 million civilian deaths; their conquerors, the Allies, suffered far
more: at least 35 million civilian deaths. 

An astonishing 10 to 20% of the total populations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and
Yugoslavia perished.  British
Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill, in characteristically vivid
prose, described postwar Europe as ‘a rubble heap, a charnel house,
a breeding ground of pestilence and hate’. 

Many of the largest cities of central and eastern Europe suffered
massive levels of devastation; 90% of the buildings in Cologne,
Düsseldorf, and Hamburg were gutted by Allied bombing, 70% of
the buildings in the centre of Vienna were destroyed. In Warsaw, reported John Hershey,
the Germans had ‘destroyed, systematically, street by street, alley by
alley, house by house.
